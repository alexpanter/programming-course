## Course introduction ##

What is programming?<br>
Programming through the times and development since 1940's.<br>
The role of programming and programs in Today's society.<br>
Course structure and rationale.

## Introduction to programming ##

What does it mean to program?<br>
What is a program? (an algorithm / set of instructions / expression through syntax)<br>
How do we program? (programming language)
Exemplify a program in several different languages and look for differences/similarities.


## Introduction to the terminal ##

Navigation. Listing files and folders. Creating and deleting files. Opening files.<br>
Cheat sheet of terminal commands.<br>
Introduction to text editors (VScode).<br>
Create and run a simple bash script.


## Fundamentals of discrete mathematics ##

Difference between discrete and continuous.<br>
The importance of discreteness in computers.<br>
Sets and subsets. Venn diagrams. Mathematical notation. Set operations. Sequences.<br>
Regular expressions.<br>
Functions. Recursion.<br>
Trees and graphs.


## Functional programming ##

Introduction to F#.<br>
Introduction to concept of a compiler and a program.<br>
Gapping the bridge between programming and mathematics.<br>
Programs as a sequence of mathematical expressions.<br>
Applying theory from discrete mathematics: Data structure, binding, function, recursion, algorithm design.


## Logic and circuits ##

Predicates and truth tables. Logical operators. Mathematical notation.<br>
Binary numbers. Binary operators.<br>

## Prolog crash course ##

Introduction to a programmning language built on logical operators.<br>
Focus on only very simple constructs.<br>
Reflection on its intuitiveness.


## Procedural programming ##

Simple, procedural programming with C.<br>
Fundamental programming building blocks: Function call, struct, array, number, pointer, control flow.<br>
Working with files.<br>

## Imperative programming ##

Introduction to imperative programming with Python.<br>
Importing libraries for: Plotting of graphs, receiving and parsing web pages, GUI programming with PyGame.


## Object-oriented programming ##

Introducing C#.<br>
Simple constructs: Namespace, class, interface, property, field.<br>
Mechanics: Inheritance or composition, polymorphism, generics.


## Programming paradigms summary ##



## Paradigm reflection ##

[Object-oriented programming is dead. Wait, really?](https://towardsdatascience.com/object-oriented-programming-is-dead-wait-really-db1f1f05cc44)
